## Research on crypto-asset regulation in Malta and the EU

In 2018 Malta has enacted three pieces of legislation, which established a framework regulating virtual asset service providers by introducing a licensing scheme. In 2021/22 these legal documents were compared with anti-money laundering legislation and the proposal by the European Commission for a *'directive in markets of crypto-assets' (MiCA)*. The research is situated within the paradigm of mixed-methods and uses natural language processing, qualtitative data analysis, and evaluative coding to examine the narrative of Malta's competitiveness in the crypto-asset regulation. As a result, the research is embedded in the larger framework of digital identity and a framework for combatting money laundering.
